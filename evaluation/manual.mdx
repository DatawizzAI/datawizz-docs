Evaluating the performance of your AI models is a crucial step in the model development process. Datawizz provides a simple way to compare multiple models side-by-side and evaluate their performance. This can help you identify the best performing model and make informed decisions about which model to deploy.

## Comparing models

The datawizz platform has a convinient UI for sending requests to multiple models and comparing their responses side-by-side. You can use this to compare both public models from providers like OpenAI and custom models trained on your own data.

<Note>Please noe that custom trained models must be deployed before they can be evaluated. Please deploy your model to Datawizz after training before proceeding with the evaluation.</Note>

To evaluate models:

1. Head over to the providers section in the Datawizz dashboard.
2. Select the models you want to compare under the different providers. You can select multiple models from the same provider or different providers.
3. Click the "Compare" button on the top right corner of the page.

In the comparison view, you can either create your own messages, or open the "Saved Prompts" drawer to use inputs fron your existing request logs.
