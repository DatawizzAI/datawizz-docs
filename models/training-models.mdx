This tutorial will take you through the steps to train & deploy your first specialized language model with Datawizz.

This tutorial assumes you already have a project set up on Datawizz with some logs saved which we will train the new model from.

# Training a Model

To train a model, head to the models section of your project and click "+ New Model":

![Add Model](/images/training-models/new-model-1.png)

In the new model page, follow the on-screen instructions to configure the base model, training data and training parameters:

![Configure Model](/images/training-models/model-config-1.png)

## Training Methods

Datawizz supports multiple training methods:

- **SFT** (Supervised Fine-Tuning): Standard fine-tuning approach for general instruction following
- **GRPO**: Goal-based training method for specific objectives
- **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization): Training with preference pairs using chosen and rejected responses
- **Reranker**: Training models to rank and reorder outputs

### DPO Training

When selecting DPO as your training method, you'll need to configure chosen and rejected tags:

- **Chosen Tag**: Select the output tag that represents preferred responses
- **Rejected Tag**: Select the output tag that represents less preferred responses

Make sure your dataset contains outputs with both chosen and rejected tags for DPO training to work properly.

## Training Parameters

The training configuration includes several parameters with validation:

- **Validation Split**: Must be between 0 and 1 (represents the proportion of data used for validation)
- **Maximum Sequence Length**: Must be a positive integer when specified
- **Number of Epochs**: Range from 1 to 100
- **Learning Rate**: Range from 0.00001 to 0.1

Once you create the model, the training process will start. You can monitor training progress and logs in the model page, including dataset loading progress. Note that model training can take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of the training configurations you use.

# Model Deployment

Once the model is trained, you can deploy it on Datawizz to start testing it and using it in your applications. To deploy a model, click the "Deploy Model" button in the model page and select Datawizz Serveless as the provider:

![Deploy Model](/images/training-models/deploy-model-1.png)

Datawizz Serveless is a serverless platform that allows you to deploy and run your models without worrying about infrastructure. You can just start calling your model and pay per token without having to worry about scaling or managing servers.

Once the model is deployed, you can use it in an endpoint, or select it for manual comparison in the providers section of your project:

Datawizz also supports additional providers for model deployment. See the docs here: [Model Deployment](/models/model-deployment).
