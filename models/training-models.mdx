This tutorial assumes you already have a project set up on Datawizz with some logs saved which we will train the new model from.

# Training Methods

Datawizz supports multiple training methods to fine-tune your language models:

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **SFT** (Supervised Fine-Tuning) | Standard fine-tuning on input-output pairs | General task adaptation |
| **GRPO** | Generalized Reward-based Policy Optimization | Reinforcement learning from human feedback |
| **Reranker** | Training models to rank responses | Response ranking and selection |
| **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization) | Training on preference pairs without reward modeling | Aligning models with human preferences |
| **KTO** (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) | Preference learning using individual feedback scores | Learning from scored outputs without pairs |

## DPO Training

DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) allows you to train models on preference data where you have pairs of chosen and rejected responses. This method is useful for aligning models with human preferences without requiring a separate reward model.

### Setting up DPO Training

1. **Select DPO Method**: When creating a new model, select "DPO" as your training method
2. **Configure Tags**: You'll need to specify:
   - **Chosen Tag**: The tag that marks preferred responses in your dataset
   - **Rejected Tag**: The tag that marks less preferred responses in your dataset
3. **Data Requirements**: Your dataset items must have outputs tagged with both chosen and rejected labels

### DPO Data Format

For DPO training, each dataset item should contain multiple outputs with appropriate tags:
- Outputs tagged as "chosen" represent the preferred responses
- Outputs tagged as "rejected" represent the less preferred responses
- Each output must have exactly one tag for proper DPO training

## KTO Training

KTO (Kahneman-Tverzy Optimization) enables preference learning from individual feedback scores rather than paired preferences. This method is ideal when you have scored outputs but don't have explicit preference pairs.

### Setting up KTO Training

1. **Select KTO Method**: Choose "KTO" as your training method when creating a new model
2. **Configure Output Tag**: Specify which output tag contains your scored data
3. **Score Requirements**: Your outputs should include feedback scores that KTO can use to determine preferences

### KTO Data Format

For KTO training:
- Outputs should contain feedback scores in the `feedback.scores` field
- Scores are aggregated using a weighted average
- Scores ≥ 0.5 are treated as positive examples, < 0.5 as negative
- Only outputs with usable feedback scores are included in training

# Training a Model

To train a model, head to the models section of your project and click "+ New Model":

![Add Model](/images/training-models/new-model-1.png)

In the new model page, follow the on-screen instructions to configure the base model, training data and training parameters:

![Configure Model](/images/training-models/model-config-1.png)

Once you create the model, the training process will start. You can monitor training progress and logs in the model page. Note that model training can take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of the training configurations you use.

# Model Deployment

Once the model is trained, you can deploy it on Datawizz to start testing it and using it in your applications. To deploy a model, click the "Deploy Model" button in the model page and select Datawizz Serveless as the provider:

Datawizz Serveless is a serverless platform that allows you to deploy and run your models without worrying about infrastructure. You can just start calling your model and pay per token without having to worry about scaling or managing servers.

Once the model is deployed, you can use it in an endpoint, or select it for manual comparison in the providers section of your project:

Datawizz also supports additional providers for model deployment. See the docs here: [Model Deployment](/models/model-deployment).
