By supporting multiple LLM providers, Datawizz enables you to:

1. **Compare performance** across different models and providers
2. **Optimize costs** by routing to the most cost-effective model for each use case
3. **Enhance reliability** through fallback mechanisms
4. **Leverage strengths** of different models for specific tasks

For more information on configuring providers and routing strategies, see our [Routing documentation](/endpoints/routing).
