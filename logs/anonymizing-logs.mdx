title: 'Anonymizing Logs (PII Removal)'
description: 'Remove PII from logs to ensure user privacy & compliance'
---

Datawizz lets you configure endpoints to annonimize logs by removing personally identifiable information (PII) from the logs. This can be useful to ensure user privacy and comply with regulations like GDPR.

If there's a high risk of users sending sensative PII to your AI system, you should consider enabling PII removal to ensure that this information is not stored in the logs. You can also select specific entity types to remove from logs to constrain PII removal scope.

## Configuring PII Removal

To enable PII removal, turn on the `Anonymize Logs` option at the endpoint settings. You may also configure two additional options:

- **Score Threshold**: The minimum confidence score required to remove an entity from the log. If the entity has a confidence score below this threshold, it will not be removed - this is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the lowest confidence and 1 being the highest.
- **Entities**: a comma separated list of entity types to remove from the logs. If you leave this field blank, all entities will be removed. See supported entity types below.
